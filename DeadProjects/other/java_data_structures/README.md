## Example Gradle Project

Run `gradle test` for test.

See **"Data Structures and Algorithms in Java" by Robert Lafore** for source code.

### Current list of completed numbers:

- Done number **2.4**. Need to implement `merge` function for **2.5**. Other tasks at the end of **2nd** chapter are too simple.
